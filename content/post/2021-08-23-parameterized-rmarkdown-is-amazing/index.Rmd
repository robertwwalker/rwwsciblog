# Parameterized R Markdown

A while back, I learned that you can parameterize markdown.  You can send it something to process as argument.  This is amazing.  Let me show an example.

First, I want to build an RMarkdown file.  In *RStudio*, that is `File > New file > R Markdown`.

We will need to add a bit of metadata to the top.  The key component is the `params:` argument.  I want to pass a `ticker` with a default option.

Now, let's build up an example.

I want to load a few libraries.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyquant)
library(ggplot2)
library(fpp3)
```

```
library(tidyquant)
library(ggplot2)
library(fpp3)
```

Without loading anything else, this markdown is aware of what I passed it in `params$ticker`.  But `tidyquant` can make use of tickers and retrieve market OHLC data.  So let me proxy that behavior with Goldman Sachs as the example.

```{r}
params <- NULL
params$ticker <- "GS"
```

Now my environment looks the same.  Let me use `tq_get` to get the data.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dat <- tq_get(params$ticker)
```

Now I want to use a special *geometry* for OHLC data.  I will also give it a title that deploys the ticker and use the special theme.

```{r}
dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
    geom_barchart(aes(open = open, high = high, low = low, close = close)) +
    labs(title = paste(params$ticker,"Bar Chart"), y = "Closing Price", x = "") + 
    theme_tq()
```

Let's look at a smooth with a simple 50 day moving average.

```{r}
dat %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
    geom_line() +           # Plot stock price
    geom_bbands(aes(high = high, low = low, close = close), ma_fun = SMA, n = 50)
```


We can also invoke `tidyquant` functions of the data, like returns or more complicated financial quantities.  

```{r PlotRet}
dat %>% tq_transmute(select= adjusted, 
                 mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
                 period     = "daily", 
                 col_rename = "Ra") %>% 
  as_tsibble(index=date) %>% 
  autoplot()
```

After I have the model report written, I can save the file and stop.  The key is to note the file name and the full path.  I will store mine in whatever my current working directory is.  I want two more libraries; I need the `rmarkdown` library to *render* the file and I need the `purrr` library to *map* my tickers into render.  I created a little function for this called `Equity.Analyser` to simplify my use of map.  `tidyquant` has a function for acquiring all of the basic data on members of an index or exchange.  I want to choose the S and P 400 and then generate a report for each one.  The one trick is that I need a simple vector to pass to map so I unlist the column.  This produced nearly 370 little reports in about 10 minutes.

```
library(rmarkdown)
library(purrr)
Equity.Analyser <- function(x) {
  render("TQ-Parameters.Rmd", params = list(ticker = x), output_file = paste0(x,"-TQ-Parameters.html"))
}
SP400 <- tq_index("SP400") 
SP400 %>% select(symbol) %>% unlist() %>% map(., Equity.Analyser)
```
