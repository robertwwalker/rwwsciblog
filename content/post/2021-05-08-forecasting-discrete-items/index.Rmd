# Abstract

Many industrial applications of forecasting tools involve discrete warehousing decisions that are underrepresented in the literature on forecasting.  This paper considers the use of combination of the underlying probabilistic core of discrete problems with insights from literature on forecast reconciliation to examine solutions to this problem.  We consider a hypothetical problem and pose a solution that combines aspects of automated forecasting and model selection with the need for forecasting methods for discrete units.
