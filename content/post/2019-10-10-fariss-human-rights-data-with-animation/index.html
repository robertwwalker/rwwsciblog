<p>Chris Fariss has some really neat data on international human rights that are really interesting to visualize for insight into the development of human rights over time. The data arise from measurement models applied to a variety of underlying indicators and they are presented in rather easy to work with forms. The basic structure is panel data. Let’s see what we have.</p>
<div id="fariss-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Fariss Data</h2>
<p>Is neat and complete. What does a basic summary look like?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>load(&quot;FarissHRData.RData&quot;)
skimr::skim(HR.Data) %&gt;% kable() %&gt;% scroll_box(width = &quot;500px&quot;, height = &quot;400px&quot;)</code></pre>
<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 0px; overflow-y: scroll; height:400px; overflow-x: scroll; width:500px; ">
